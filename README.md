# Sales Dashboard ‚Äî Next.js (App Router) + NestJS (code)  

A production-ready dashboard based on the given Figma. The UI is built with **Next.js 14** and **MUI**, and the API endpoints are **implemented twice**:

1) **Deployed (production)**: **Next.js API routes** (serverless), with Swagger UI hosted **inside** the Next app.  
2) **Code-only (not deployed)**: A full **NestJS + TypeORM** backend lives in `backend/` for completeness and local testing.

> **Why Next.js for the live backend?**  
> Render and Railway require payment methods and are not fully free in practice. I used **free trials/credits** for evaluation, but for a frictionless live demo I shipped the backend using **Next API routes on Vercel**.  
> - Production site: **https://sales-dashboard-template.vercel.app**  
> - Swagger (UI hosted in Next): **https://sales-dashboard-template.vercel.app/swagger**
